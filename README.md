# lispyboi

A Common Lisp-like Lisp implementation.

The interpreter features an optimizing compiler, bytecode interpreter and a tracing
garbage collector, and a trivial foreign function interface. The runtime features a
typical macro system, packages, late-binding function resolution and functions and
variables are in separate namespaces making lispyboi a Lisp-2.
